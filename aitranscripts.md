Let me search more broadly for any testimonial-like content: Let me read the about.html file to see if there are any fake testimonials or success stories there: Let me continue reading the about.html file: Now let me search for any testimonial content in other HTML files: Let me check the contact.html file which mentioned score improvements in the grep search: Let me read that section of contact.html to see if there are fake testimonials there: I found the issue! There's a fake claim about score improvements. Let me also check if there are any other fake testimonials or unrealistic claims. Let me search for student success stories or testimonials: Perfect! I found the fake testimonials and unrealistic claims that need to be removed. Here are the issues:

1. **Contact.html**: Claims about "our students typically see 100-300 point improvements" - this is a fake testimonial since there's no evidence of actual students with these results
2. **About.html**: Claims about "dramatic score improvements" without evidence

Let me fix these by removing the fake testimonials and unrealistic claims:
